"""Swappable corpus for the head-to-head demo. Edit freely and re-run.

Each entry has `text` (what plain RAG indexes). Entries that are time-stamped facts
also carry a `fact` triple + `year` (what RAGBrain ingests, with the year as the
fact's valid-from). Distractors have only `text`.

The scenario: Acme Corp was HQ'd in Boston for years (lots of Boston text), then quietly
moved to Denver (one understated update). Plain similarity retrieval favors the abundant,
keyword-matching Boston text and, under top-k, drops the lone Denver update - so RAG
answers the stale city. RAGBrain knows Denver superseded Boston and answers the current
one (and, asked as-of an earlier date, correctly answers Boston).
