# Cogniflow

**Temporal, self-falsifying belief substrate for agentic RAG.** The combination of a
bi-temporal knowledge graph (à la Graphiti) with an agentic retrieval loop (à la
LlamaIndex), welded by a closed feedback loop: retrieve → check validity → falsify
superseded beliefs → persist the verdict → reshape the next retrieval.

This is **ChronoRAG** (temporal) × **PALIMPSEST** (self-falsifying) as a library.

> **Status: Phase 1b (walking skeleton, through the agent path).**
> Done: the substrate slice (1a) plus the LlamaIndex bridge. THE heartbeat now runs
> end to end through a `ReActAgent` -> `TemporalGraphRetriever` (seam a) ->
> `TemporalValidityPostprocessor` (seam b) -> substrate: the same question at
> `as_of=2020` vs `as_of=2023` returns Boston vs Denver. One shared validity
> definition (`core.policies`) governs both the substrate read and the postprocessor.
> Note: the agent is a `ReActAgent` because the configured LLM (MiniMax-M3) emits no
> native tool calls; FunctionAgent works if a function-calling model is configured.
> Deferred: write-back (seam d), pluggable policies, replay API, inline verification
> (seam c), advanced rerank.

## Design rule

The **core is dependency-free**. `cogniflow.core` imports nothing but the standard
library. Heavy dependencies (`graphiti-core`, `llama-index-core`, `falkordb`) are pulled
in only by *backends* and *bridges*, and only when their optional extras are installed.
This is what keeps the contracts stable and the architecture pluggable.

### The three substrate operations
- **write(episode)** → `WriteReceipt` — ingest a source episode into beliefs.
- **read(query)** → `RetrievalResult` — retrieve beliefs valid as-of a point in time.
- **falsify(target, against=…)** → `FalsificationVerdict` — decide if a belief is superseded.

### The four policy interfaces (the seams from the design analysis)
| Policy | Seam | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `RetrievalPolicy` | read | how to resolve as-of and rank candidates |
| `ValidityPolicy` | invalidate | is this belief valid at time *t*? |
| `FalsificationPolicy` | falsify | is this belief superseded, and by what? |
| `WritebackPolicy` | write-back | should a retrieval outcome become a new belief? |

## Install (dev)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Prove the skeleton

```bash
ruff check .
pytest
```

Phase-0 proof: the contracts are stable (field-surface is frozen by tests), a no-op
backend passes the conformance stub, and CI is green across Python 3.10–3.12.
