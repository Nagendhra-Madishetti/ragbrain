"""ragbrain - temporal, self-falsifying belief substrate for agentic RAG.

milestone exposes only the stable contracts and core types. Backends and bridges
are imported explicitly from their submodules so that the top-level import stays
dependency-free.

from __future__ import annotations

# The in-memory backend is the one exception to "backends live in submodules":
# it is stdlib-only, so exporting it here keeps the top-level import
# dependency-free while letting the quickstart run straight after pip install.
