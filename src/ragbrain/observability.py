"""Observability for the read / write-back path.

A single ``emit`` fans every event out to: (1) structured logging (always),
(2) any registered in-process sinks (used by tests to verify the trace-emission
contract), and (3) Langfuse when ``LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`` is configured (a no-op
otherwise). The Langfuse path and the sink path go through the same ``emit``, so a
test that asserts on sinks is exercising the exact code path Langfuse rides on.
